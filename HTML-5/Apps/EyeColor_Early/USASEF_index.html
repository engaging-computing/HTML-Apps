<!--	NOTE:
		These WebApps are all old and not terribly useful.
		The first app was a proof of concept, but did some math in order to
		get the Lat & Long of a mouse click on the map. It didn't support zoom
		and the others that do attempt to do a zoom either don't work or mess up
		the lat & long badly.
		As a result I've left these apps as is as the Google Maps API version of this
		WebApp works great.		-->
